# smt-2-hard-mode-patch
This is a comprehensive rehash of Shin Megami Tensei II (JP-SNES Version) to make it more like its modern counterparts in regards to its difficulty and challenge. Most SMT2 players feel that the bosses in the original are complete jokes, with some exceptions like Lucifer and YHVH. This mod will completely break the limits and maybe even you.
